– March 11, 2020 – MaxLinear, Inc. (NYSE: MXL), a leading provider of radio frequency (RF), analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits for the connected home, wired and wireless infrastructure, and industrial and multimarket applications, today announced that Optoway Technology Inc., a key provider of fiber-optic networking products with over 19 years of experience designing optical components and transceiver products found anywhere from deep beneath the ocean to the data center cluster, has selected MaxLinear’s second-generation Telluride PAM4 DSP, the MxL93516, to develop sub-3.5 watt 100G single lambda DR and LR optical modules.

 

The second-generation MxL93516 extends MaxLinear’s PAM4 DSP offering, by enabling sub-3.5W QSFP28 and SFP-DD 100G optical modules. Like the first-generation Telluride DSPs, the new device offers a monolithically integrated EA-EML laser driver that significantly reduces the overall optical module BOM cost.

 

The industry-leading low power consumption of the new optical modules extend Optoway Technology’s broad offering of telecommunications and data center products. Optoway Technlogy’s experience in telecommunications and data center transceiver design along with their manufacturing capabilities enable the company to meet the growing demands of its customers.

 

“We are excited to see the adoption of our second-generation Telluride PAM4 DSP by Optoway for their 100Gbps QSFP28 transceiver modules,” said Will Torgerson, Vice President and General Manager of MaxLinear’s High-Speed Interconnect Group. “Telluride’s high level of integration and performance enable companies like Optoway to develop low power, small form factor, 100G optical interconnects for next-generation hyperscale data centers.”



“When we surveyed the PAM4 DSP market for our next gen DR1 module, we discovered that only MaxLinear’s second-generation PAM4 DSP enabled a path to sub-3.5W DR1 modules,” said Isabella Chien, General Manager of Optoway Technology Inc. “We are excited to sample our first-generation optical transceivers to address broader market segments requiring sub-3.5W modules.”

 



The MxL93516 is part of MaxLinear’s second-generation Telluride family of low-power, high-performance PAM4 DSP SoCs. The industry leading family consists of the MxL93515 and MxL93516. The MxL93516 100G PAM4 DSP integrates an EA-EML driver with 1.8V PP SE swing. The MxL93515 offers a differential 800mV peak-to-peak swing for non-EA-EML-based optics. These PAM4 DSPs enable 100Gbps QSFP28 optical modules using 4*25G NRZ host interface to 1*100G PAM4 optical interface and SFP-DD optical modules using 2*50G PAM4 host interface to 1*100G PAM4 optical interface.

 

MaxLinear has engineered a very high-performance DSP engine in both the transmit and receive data paths. The resulting superior link-margin enables single-lane 100Gbps optical wavelength technology by mitigating many of the limitations of mass production optical components.

 

The devices feature a comprehensive digital pre-distortion (DPD) engine in the transmit direction to compensate for laser non-linearity and to cancel packaging limitations that cause reflections and bandwidth degradation at these extremely high signal frequencies. On the receive path, the DSP includes an auto-adaptive signal enhancement engine, which integrates a continuous time linear equalizer (CTLE), automatic gain control (AGC), a feed forward equalizer (FFE), and a decision feedback equalizer (DFE).
