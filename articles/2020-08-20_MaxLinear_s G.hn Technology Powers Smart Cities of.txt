“UVAX solutions are driving interconnectivity as a powerful tool for offering better services and lifestyles to citizens. By adding MaxLinear G.hn technology to its innovative solutions for Smart Cities, UVAX builds on a strong G.hn backbone for powering the outdoor lighting network of the city,” said Antonio Royo, Chief Executive Officer at UVAX. “We are converting the underutilized public lighting infrastructure into a data highway to interconnect thousands of sensors and IP devices and aggregating them into a TCP/IP system with remote control features.”

 

“MaxLinear is delighted to see its world-renowned G.hn technology implemented in the future-proof grid of the Smart Cities,” said Will Torgerson, Vice President & General Manager of MaxLinear’s Broadband Group. “The G.hn-based UVAX solutions will set up an energy efficient platform for Smart Cities of the future allowing a whole new range of applications to be built on the robustness of G.hn technology.”

 

Scalability and remote control are key advantages of the UVAX solution, enabling gradual integration of IP products ranging from security devices to adaptive lighting, information panels and highway safety signs. More than 150 cities worldwide have benefitted from the UVAX CSL solution, which integrates video surveillance, sensor networks, Wi-Fi access points and EV charging stations. All communication is enabled through G.hn implemented in the powerlines of the LED streetlight network.
