CARLSBAD, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MaxLinear, Inc. (Nasdaq: MXL), a leader in broadband access solutions, today announced the availability of its DOCSIS 4.0 SoC cable modem and gateway platform, Puma 8. Puma 8 builds on the success of its DOCSIS 3.0 and 3.1 predecessors (Puma 6 and 7) and includes all critical elements of a DOCSIS platform, including a low-power, ultra-high split upstream PGA. The platform is compliant to the DOCSIS 4.0 frequency division duplex (FDD) specification and enables immediate large-scale deployments as a DOCSIS 3.1 device with gradual feature expansion options without the need for costly CPE replacements. Complete modem, Embedded Multimedia Terminal Adapter (EMTA), and gateway platforms will be available from MaxLinear’s early access OEM partners in 2024.
MaxLinear’s DOCSIS 4.0 platform stands out in the market as an energy-efficient, performance-optimized solution. It aligns perfectly with the deployment strategies and technology requirements of leading MSOs. The Puma 8 platform has been specifically tailored to support Extended Spectrum DOCSIS (ESD)/Frequency Division Duplex (FDD), and it boasts a range of energy-saving features. Even at full utilization, its power consumption is impressively low, at just 20-25W, which is almost half that of competing solutions. This low power consumption enables a fan-less design, resulting in not only cost savings but also space conservation. To achieve peak performance with industry-leading low power consumption, MaxLinear employed a collaborative co-design approach, encompassing the DOCSIS SoC, AnyWAN SoC, and the programmable gain amplifier (PGA).
“We’ve harnessed our extensive IP portfolio and system knowledge to develop a comprehensive DOCSIS 4.0 system and platform, adopting a holistic strategy that encompasses a full suite of interrelated functionalities spanning every aspect of the system,” stated Will Torgerson, Vice President and General Manager of the Broadband Business Unit. “MaxLinear’s solutions empower service providers with innovation, flexibility, and reliable options.”
MaxLinear’s DOCSIS 4.0 platform offers MSOs a distinctive opportunity to effectively address the growing demand for internet access bandwidth and increased competition. With the ability to support the full capabilities of DOCSIS 3.1 and the added benefit of field upgradability to DOCSIS 4.0 when needed, the flexibility of this platform provides a significant market advantage: It minimizes service disruptions; ensures a seamless transition to the latest technology; and, optimizes investment in network infrastructure so it is similar to historical technology upgrade cycles, which are significantly more cost-effective compared to full fiber deployments. MaxLinear is dedicated to providing cost-optimized configurations for both EMTA and wireless gateway implementations, thereby reducing platform costs and operational overhead.
DOCSIS 4.0 addresses a critical need by MSOs for higher service rates exceeding 10Gbps. The proliferation of data intensive applications like remote work, VR/IR, online gaming, 4/8K streaming and large numbers of IoT devices continues to rise at a steady rate. Additional complementary improvements in low latency, and the ability to offer symmetrical multi-gigabit internet service options, provide a wider range of options to MSOs for incremental network expansion and service offerings.
Several market leading OEM partners have developed MaxLinear-based DOCSIS 4.0 platforms in preparation of compliance and interoperability testing, field trials, and mass production deployments during 2024. MaxLinear’s early access partners include but are not limited to industry leaders like Askey, CommScope, and Hitron.
Access to MaxLinear’s Puma 8 chipset will not require any restrictive Joint Development Agreements by MSOs. MaxLinear is committed to advancing innovation by fostering a transparent collaboration environment for interested MSOs and OEM customers.
