    "title": "MaxLinear to Showcase Panther III at Future of Memory and Storage 2024 Trade Show",
    "date": "2024-07-30",
    "content": "CARLSBAD, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MaxLinear, Inc. (Nasdaq: MXL), a leading provider of data storage acceleration solutions for enterprise and data center applications, today announced it will demonstrate the advanced compression, encryption, and security performance of its storage acceleration solution, Panther III, at the Future of Memory and Storage (FMS) 2024 trade show from August 6-8, 2024. The demos will show that Panther III can achieve up to 40 times more throughput, up to 190 times better latency, and up to 1000 times less CPU utilization than a software-only solution, leading to significant cost savings in terms of flash drives and needed CPU cores.\n\r\n\n\r\nMaxLinear’s Panther III creates a bold new product category for maximizing the performance of data storage systems - a comprehensive, all-in-one “storage accelerator.” Unlike encryption and/or compression solutions, MaxLinear’s Panther III consolidates a comprehensive suite of storage acceleration functions, including compression, deduplication, encryption, data protection, and real-time validation, in a single hardware-based solution. Panther III is engineered to offload and expedite specific data processing tasks, thus providing a significant performance boost, storage cost savings, and energy savings compared to traditional software-only, FPGA, and other competitive solutions.\n“Panther III meets the needs of both data center administrators, who are desperate for power efficiency and cost-saving storage solutions with the rise of AI, and also dataset owners – who want to store and access their data quickly, securely, and accurately,” said Vikas Choudhary, Vice President of Ethernet & Storage Accelerators at MaxLinear. “Panther III represents a significant advancement in data storage systems technology, offering an unmatched solution for how the world of data management and storage is rapidly evolving.”\nThe data storage market is showing enormous growth, driven largely by the rise of AI. According to a report published in 2024 by Fortune Business Insights, the global cloud storage market size was valued at $108.69 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow to $665 billion by 2032, with a CAGR of 22.4% during the forecast period. This growth is driving an adjacent surge in power usage. A report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) found that the 460 terawatt-hours (TWh) consumed by data centers in 2022 represented 2% of all global electricity usage. Much of that was driven by computing and cooling functions within data centers. Further, the Uptime Institute predicts AI will account for 10% of the data center industry's global power use by 2025.\nMaxLinear's Panther III introduces a paradigm shift in cost efficiency in two ways: Reducing the number of CPU cores needed for common storage operation like encryption and compression; and, through a 12:1 data reduction ratio, reducing the cost per GB of flash drives needed for storage.\nSoftware-only solutions for data compression and encryption, while flexible, come with significant hidden costs, primarily due to their reliance on CPU cores. In scenarios where high data throughput is required, the number of CPU cores needed can be staggering. For instance, achieving a data throughput rate of 200Gbps using traditional software based Deflate compression and SHA256 hash requires approximately 3,100 CPU cores. Given that the cost of a CPU core is estimated at $50, the total cost for the CPU cores alone would amount to $157,000. Panther III achieves the same 200Gbps data throughput rate using just three CPU cores.\nWith regards to flash drives, Panther III provides significant cost savings. With a 1U AFA storage server equipped with eight 1TB NVMe drives, each drive costs approximately $240. This setup provides a raw storage capacity of 8TB. However, when factoring in typical storage overheads and the lack of compression, the effective capacity remains limited. In this scenario, the system storage cost is 25 cents per GB, which can quickly escalate as data storage needs grow. With a 12:1 data reduction ratio, Panther III significantly increases the effective storage capacity of NVMe drives. In the example of an 8-drive 1U AFA storage server, Panther III transforms the effective capacity from 8TB to a remarkable 96TB. This dramatic enhancement means that organizations can store substantially more data on fewer drives, leading to significant cost savings.\nMaxLinear will showcase demonstrations of the Panther III storage accelerator. The first will highlight the power of offloading with a single Panther III card delivering 200G throughput, showcasing increased memory bandwidth and enhanced power savings. Attendees will witness how Panther III’s hardware acceleration outperforms traditional software solutions, efficiently handling intensive workloads with superior performance and reduced energy consumption.\nThe second demonstration will display the seamless scalability of Panther III with multiple cards working in unison within a single server. This demo will emphasize the scalability and performance benefits that data center customers can achieve, showing firsthand how Panther III maintains high performance, ultra-low latency and efficiency as it scales with minimal power usage.\nJoin MaxLinear at Booth 515 at the FMS: Future of Memory and Storage 2024 trade show to explore the latest innovations in storage acceleration technology and discover how Panther III can elevate your data center performance to new heights.",

    "content": "CARLSBAD, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- \n, Inc. (NASDAQ: MXL), an industry leader in silicon solutions for 5G wireless infrastructure, announced today a key partnership with \n, Inc. to develop a reference design for Massive MIMO Radio Units (RU) with improved spectrum reuse through the use of their respective high performance technologies. The partnership pairs Airgain’s latest 64T64R antenna array with MaxLinear’s MXL1550 8T8R transceiver and innovative new AI/ML-powered beamforming algorithms in support of a growing global Massive MIMO market estimated to reach US$9.62B by 2026, according to Market Data Forecast.\nAs enterprise and consumer demand for faster and more reliable wireless service continues to explode, mobile operators must adopt new technologies to meet this ever-growing need. Massive MIMO radios, which use a much larger number of antennas, have yet to realize their full potential as the key radio technology that will dramatically increase wireless network capacity. However, while Massive MIMO RUs can theoretically improve spectral efficiency by up to 10X when compared with traditional Macro RUs, deployments to date have only shown a fraction of those benefits.

    "title": "MaxLinear’s High-Speed MxL85110 Modem Enables Technetix Virtual Segmentation™ for Wireless Backhaul Deployment over Cable",
    "date": "2020-03-31",
    "content": "– March 31, 2020 – MaxLinear, Inc. (NYSE: MXL), a leading provider of radio frequency (RF), analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits for the connected home, wired and wireless infrastructure, and industrial and multimarket applications, today announced that Technetix Group’s Virtual Segmentation solution is in production driven by its MxL85110 broadband modem enabling gigabit throughput over coaxial cable infrastructure.\n\r\n \n\r\n5G represents an opportunity for the cable operators to provide backhaul for either wireless companies or themselves. The technical barriers that have prevented the operator cable plant being used for this application have been overcome by MaxLinear’s MxL85110; namely gigabit throughputs and low latency overlaying above established DOCSIS traffic. The established cable infrastructure has a significant footprint and scale (compared to fiber) and is situated in ideal locations for small cell backhaul, mid-haul or fronthaul applications and offers the capability for powering that fiber does not permit.\n\r\n \n\r\nAs mobile network operators (MNOs) face the challenge of providing high bandwidth fronthaul and backhaul networks to address the bandwidth and low latency requirements of future 5G services, Technetix’s Virtual Segmentation product range provides high-speed connections using the existing coaxial cable infrastructure. This saves the cost of laying new fiber-optic cabling, providing Cable Operators with new flexibility in terms of where to locate nodes and how to provide connectivity to their core network.\n\r\n \n\r\nThe Technetix Virtual Segmentation product uses MaxLinear’s MxL85110 chipset. The MxL85110 provides up to 20Gbps (10 downstream + 10 upstream) Ethernet capacity, ultra-low latency of 5 microseconds per node, and adaptive code modulation ranging from BPSK to 1024 QAM. The device can be programmed for flexible bandwidth from 25MHz to 2GHz, with independent asymmetric transmit and receive configuration. It also delivers the highest spectral and payload efficiency for productive utilization of cable bandwidth with no MAC-layer overhead. Additional features include carrier-grade synchronous Ethernet and IEEE 1588v2 synchronization and an integrated management channel.\n\r\n \n\r\n“The Technetix Virtual Segmentation solution provides extra bandwidth on existing coaxial cable alleviating the need to deploy fiber,” said Brendan Walsh, Vice President of MaxLinear’s Wireless Infrastructure Group. “This capability allows for new service deployment (such as mobile backhaul) in weeks rather than months.”\n\r\n \n\r\n“Our carrier customers are demanding fronthaul and backhaul solutions that have the throughput and low latency performance to handle 5G services,” said Paul Broadhurst, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Technetix. “By using MaxLinear’s high-speed data platform, the opportunity for 5G Backhaul for Cable Operators has become a reality, along with virtual node segmentation and the delivery of B2B data services.”\n\r\n \n\r\nThe innovative Virtual Segmentation solution by Technetix allows Cable Operators to create a virtual 10GE pipe over the existing coaxial network. This high bandwidth connection can be used to deploy R-PHY without deploying fiber; providing Cable Operators with great savings over fiber deployment time and capex. Virtual Segmentation enables this high bandwidth by overlaying additional data on the high frequency bands available on the coax cable.\n\r\n \n\r\nFor additional information on the MxL85110, visit \n.\n\r\n \n\r\n\n\r\nMaxLinear, Inc.

    "title": "MaxLinear PAM4 DSP Enables uSenlight Corporation to Develop 400G Optical Modules for Hyperscale Data Centers",
    "date": "2020-04-02",
    "content": "– April 02, 2020 – MaxLinear, Inc. (NYSE: MXL), a leading provider of radio frequency (RF), analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits for the connected home, wired and wireless infrastructure, and industrial and multimarket applications, today announced that uSenlight Corporation, a key OEM developing high speed, high performance, reliable integrated optical modules for datacenter, FTTx, optical networking and CPRI/LTE applications, has selected MaxLinear’s MxL93542, Telluride PAM4 DSP, to develop its next-generation 400G-DR4 and FR4 optical modules.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe new optical modules build upon the success of uSenlight’s current product offerings of 100G QSFP28 PSM4 and 100G QSFP28 CWDM4 modules for data center connectivity. uSenlight’s experience in data center transceiver design and its manufacturing capabilities enable them to meet the growing demands of hyperscale data center customers.\n\r\n \n\r\nMaxLinear’s MxL935xx Telluride PAM4 DSPs are key components in the development of high-speed, mega-scale data centers based on 100Gbps single lambda optical interconnects. These SOCs are the world’s first DSPs with integrated electro-absorption modulated laser (EA-EML) drivers for 100/400Gbps optical interconnects and breakout mode clocking support for 400Gbps DR4 optical modules. The MxL93542 400G PAM4 DSP allows companies like uSenlight to develop a 400Gbps optical interconnect module in a compact form factor for intra-datacenter applications with a transmission distance up to 2 kilometers.\n\r\n \n\r\n“Telluride DSPs offer industry leading integration, power consumption, and link-margin performance,” said Will Torgerson, Vice President and General Manager of MaxLinear’s High-Speed Interconnect Group. \"We are pleased to see that these features will enable uSenlight to develop next-generation 400G-DR4 and FR4 optical modules to address the massive demand to deploy higher speed networks in next-generation hyperscale data centers.”\n\r\n \n\r\n“MaxLinear’s MxL93542 PAM4 DSP with integrated EML driver offers the highest level of integration compared with other DSPs on the market,” said Dr. Charles Wu, President of uSenlight Corporation. “The integration and performance of the MxL93542 PAM4 DSP is enabling us to expand our portfolio by developing 400Gbps optical interconnects for hyperscale datacenters.”\n\r\n \n\r\n\n\r\nThe Telluride family of low-power, high-performance PAM4 DSP SoCs enable 400Gbps optical modules using a 4x100Gbps optics interface. These SoCs are suitable for use within QSFP-DD, OSFP and COBO module form factors. The MxL93542 400G PAM4 DSP integrate an EA-EML driver with 1.8V PP SE swing. Additional options are available that offer differential 800mV peak-to-peak swing for non EA-EML-based optics.\n\r\n \n\r\nThe integrated laser driver delivers greater than 1.8V of single-ended driver output swing necessary for EA-EML lasers. This output swing easily meets the optical modulation amplitude (OMA) specification requirements across the wide operating temperature and bias ranges of all EA-EML lasers. The chip package also includes all the high frequency components required for driver and modulator biasing.\n\r\n \n\r\nAsynchronous breakout mode clocking is an essential feature for hyperscale data center customers initiating 400G DR4 deployments. MaxLinear’s 400G Telluride DSPs (MxL9354x) are currently the only PAM4 DSP SoCs that successfully integrate this clocking requirement.\n\r\n \n\r\nMaxLinear has engineered a very high-performance DSP engine in both the transmit and receive data paths. The resulting superior link-margin enables single-lane 100Gbps optical wavelength technology by mitigating many of the limitations of mass production optical components.\n\r\n \n\r\nThe devices feature a comprehensive digital pre-distortion (DPD) engine in the transmit direction to compensate for laser non-linearity and to cancel packaging limitations that cause reflections and bandwidth degradation at these extremely high signal frequencies. On the receive path, the DSP includes an auto-adaptive signal enhancement engine, which integrates a continuous time linear equalizer (CTLE), automatic gain control (AGC), a feed forward equalizer (FFE), and a decision feedback equalizer (DFE).\n\r\n \n\r\nFor additional information on the MxL93542, visit \n.\n\r\n \n\r\n\n\r\nMaxLinear, Inc.

    "date": "2020-04-09",
    "content": "– April 9, 2020 – MaxLinear, Inc. (NYSE: MXL), a leading provider of radio frequency (RF), analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits for the connected home, wired and wireless infrastructure, and industrial and multimarket applications, today announced that GiaX GmbH is in production with its HelEOS network system that delivers 10Gbps symmetrical throughput over coaxial cable infrastructure and is powered by the MxL85110 gigabit modem system on chip (SoC).\n\r\n \n\r\nThe introduction of 5G has resulted in more challenging requirements in terms of throughput, latency, reliability, and density of connections. It has also exacerbated capacity constraints already experienced in mobile networks due to increased data traffic. Fiber is the default transport network used for mobile backhaul but its deployment can be costly and time consuming. The cost of equipment and labor can quickly add up, particularly with underground networks. Further, the time, cost, and uncertainty around securing necessary approvals can be equally burdensome.\n\r\n \n\r\nLeveraging the high throughput and low latency provided by the MxL85110, the HelEOS solution provides a comprehensive Virtual Fiber™ solution that meets the evolving demands of mobile backhaul over the cable network without having to install fiber. By using the HelEOS solution, cable operators can take advantage of their existing coaxial infrastructure to backhaul traffic generated by 4G/5G mobile base stations. This solution enables a much faster network rollout and saves tens or potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in capital expenditures.\n\r\n \n\r\nA tier-1 European cable operator is currently deploying the HelEOS solution over their existing coaxial network to provide a 10G Ethernet overlay network as backhaul technology for Remote PHY devices.\n\r\n \n\r\n\"We are excited that the HelEOS system is in production at a Tier-1 European operator and is being trialed for mobile backhaul applications. Giax has addressed a capacity constraint within existing HFC networks enabling 5G backhaul deployment,” said Brendan Walsh, Vice President of MaxLinear’s Wireless Infrastructure Group. “By leveraging our technology, HelEOS supports data rates up to 10Gbps and has plenty of headroom to meet demands for increasing capacity. Our MxL85110 ensures throughput of up to 20Gbps is realizable using existing technology.”\n\r\n \n\r\n“The HelEOS system has been designed to support mobile backhaul. With support of synchronous Ethernet, 1588v2, and a close to single-digit microsecond delay per hop, mobile 4G/5G backhaul over coaxial cable is now possible,” said Jörg Hellwig, CEO and Company Founder of GiaX. “Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) operations and maintenance (OAM) type functionality of the HelEOS system will also be of use for the mobile operator.”\n\r\n \n\r\n\n\r\nHelEOS uses MaxLinear’s MxL85110 chipset, which provides up to 20Gbps (10Gbps downstream and 10Gbps upstream) Ethernet capacity. The MxL85110 offers ultra-low latency of five microseconds per node and adaptive code modulation ranging from BPSK to 1024 QAM. The device can be programmed for flexible bandwidth from 25MHz to 2GHz, with independent asymmetric transmit and receive configuration. It also delivers the highest spectral and payload efficiency for efficient utilization of cable bandwidth with no MAC-layer overhead. Additional features used in the HelEOS solution include carrier-grade synchronous Ethernet and IEEE 1588v2 synchronization and an integrated management channel.\n\r\n \n\r\n\n\r\nThe HelEOS 10G Ethernet overlay system is a modem and switch technology that combines point-to-point Ethernet connections over existing coaxial cables into an Ethernet overlay system on the HFC network. This Ethernet overlay system offers fiber-like speeds as well as MEF management functions. HelEOS can currently transport up to 10Gbps in both upstream and downstream directions. For the Ethernet data transmission, unused frequency spectrum above frequencies used for DOCSIS 3.x and DVBC or MPEG is utilized.  Depending on the cable type and frequencies used, transmission can be accomplished over several hundred meters.\n\r\n \n\r\nFor additional information on the MxL85110, visit \n.\n\r\n \n\r\n\n\r\nMaxLinear, Inc.

The new device adds to the Company’s existing portfolio of 1 Gigabit PHYs, 2.5 Gigabit PHYs and 1 Gigabit switches. The GPY241 is the industry’s first quad-port PHY optimized for 2.5GBASE-T Ethernet and adds USXGMII interface capability.  It enables switch and gateway manufacturers to provide multiple cost-effective 2.5G ports in High-Speed Switches, Gateways, and Routers.\n\r\n \n\r\nThe market has recently seen a rapid adoption of 2.5GBASE-T, mostly driven by new and growing broadband applications with bandwidth requirements above 1G such as 10GPON modems, DOSCIS 3.1 cable modems, Wi-Fi 6 (802.11 ax) routers, etc.  The adoption of 2.5G Ethernet will continue to grow as more PCs offer 2.5G Ethernet ports and the demand for 2.5G speeds expands into enterprise and industrial single and multiport applications. 2.5GBase-T Ethernet is clearly emerging as the mainstream, mass-market technology, and as a natural successor to 1Gb Ethernet.\n\r\n \n\r\n“The market transition from 1G to 2.5G is well underway, with 50 million ports in the market today. It is expected to approach 1 billion ports within the next 5 years,” said James Lougheed, Vice President of Marketing for High Performance Analog at MaxLinear.  “Being the first to offer a quad-port PHY solution optimized for multiport 2.5GbE applications, supporting a cumulative bandwidth of 10Gb, puts us in a unique position to support this fast-growing market.”\n\r\n \n\r\n\n\r\nLike MaxLinear’s existing single-port 2.5GbE PHYs (GPY211, GPY212, and GPY215), the quad-port GPY241 is a feature-rich, cost-performance optimized Ethernet transceiver solution. The GPY241 supports IEEE802.3 modes 2.5GBASE-T, 1000BASE-T, 100BASE-TX and 10BASE-Te. It provides great interoperability for both high data rate connections and connections to legacy 100BASE-TX and 10BASE-T devices. In addition, the GPY241 supports timestamp insertion and retrieval according to the IEEE 1588v2 standard to support industrial, transportation and mobile networking applications that require time synchronization.\n\r\n \n\r\nThis new Ethernet PHY can be connected to a switch or gateway MAC interface by either a single four-pin 10G USXGMII-4×2.5G interface or four SGMII+ interfaces. It includes an on-board low EMI line driver with integrated termination that simplifies PCB design. The device requires only 2 (using SGMII+) or 3 (using USXGMII) power supply rails. It features an integrated Smart-AZ module to support Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE, IEEE802.3az) with legacy MACs and a smart LED brightness control for link status display.\n\r\n \n\r\nThe GPY241 includes all typical PHY features such as jumbo frames up to 10kB, cable diagnostics, Wake-on-LAN (WoL) support, auto MDI/MDIX, auto polarity reversal and auto down speed for CAT3 or poor cables. It also features a typical power consumption of 1W per port in 2.5GBASE-T mode. For reduced power consumption during periods of low traffic, Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) is supported for 2.5GBASE-T, 1000BASE-T and 100BASE-TX. Additional power saving can be achieved by using the SoCs Wake-on-LAN (WoL) functionality.\n\r\n \n\r\nThe GPY241 is available now in a compact RoHS compliant 12mm x 12mm FC-BGA-256 package. An industrial grade version, the GPY245, will be available later in 2021.\n\r\n \n\r\nSamples and evaluation boards are available.  For more information, visit \n.\n\r\n \n\r\n \n\r\n\n\r\nMaxLinear, Inc.

    "date": "2021-06-01",
    "content": "– June 01, 2021 – \n (NYSE: MXL), a leading provider of radio frequency (RF), analog, digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits, announced today that the company will showcase the industry’s first 5nm CMOS 800Gbps PAM4 DSP for data center applications at the Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exhibition (OFC) from June 6 to June 11, 2021. This 800G DSP is part of MaxLinear’s new Keystone family of 5nm CMOS PAM4 DSPs available for customers.\n\r\n\n\r\nKeystone represents MaxLinear’s third generation of PAM4 DSPs. It enables small form factors, offers high integration and best-in-class power consumption, and has the flexibility to address multiple optical transceiver use cases and end markets. Keystone DSPs can address both 400G and 800G optical module applications. The extremely low power consumption and small form factor of Keystone enables both sub-8Watt 400G optical module designs (QSFP112 and QSFP-DD) and sub-15Watt 800G designs (QSFP-DD800 and OSFP). Similar to MaxLinear’s previous generation Telluride PAM4 DSP family (MxL9351x and MxL9354x), the Keystone family (MxL9364x, MxL9368x) also includes a monolithically integrated single-ended driver ideally suited for optical transceiver module implementations using electro-absorption modulated lasers (EMLs). Additionally, it features an optional monolithically integrated high-swing differential driver that can be used for direct drive of silicon photonics (SiPh) based modulators.\n\r\n\n\r\n“With the exponential growth of data traffic within hyperscale cloud networks, the needed increase in interconnect bandwidth in those networks requires lower-power, higher-density optical modules that support higher lane rates,” said Drew Guckenberger, Vice President of Optical Interconnect at MaxLinear. “We are extremely excited to announce the availability of our Keystone family of 5nm CMOS PAM4 DSPs, specifically designed to address these requirements. With our third generation Keystone DSP design, and the power advantages of 5nm CMOS technology, we are directly addressing our customers’ critical needs for low power, highly integrated, high performance interconnect solutions in next generation hyperscale cloud networks.”\n\r\n\n\r\n“We’re pleased to see the result of our collaboration with MaxLinear, a strategic technology partner of TSMC, in developing and manufacturing its leading PAM4 DSPs on TSMC’s 5nm technology to address the rapidly growing cloud datacenter network infrastructure market,” said Alex You, Vice President of Business Management, TSMC North America. “The Keystone family of SoCs are amongst the first radio-frequency mixed-signal digital SoCs leveraging TSMC’s 5nm CMOS process. The excellent power, seamless integration, and performance benchmarks set by Keystone are a testament to the advanced capabilities of our process technology, and also to MaxLinear’s design expertise in the most advanced processes.”\n\r\n \n\r\n \n\r\nKeystone is a family of highly integrated PAM4 DSP SoCs that enable 400G/800G optical interconnects. This is the first generation to provide 106.25Gbps host side electrical I/O to match the line side 106.25Gbps interface rate. This is a crucial capability for next generation 25.6T switch interfaces.\n\r\nThe Keystone family’s host side interfaces support 25.78125/25.5625/53.125/106.25Gbps signaling per lane over C2M host channels. The line side interfaces also support the same rates and are targeted for 100G/λ DR, FR, and LR applications. All devices provide extensive DSP functionality, including line-side transmitter digital pre-distortion (DPD), transmit pre-emphasis (TX FIR), receiver feed forward equalization (FFE) and decision feedback equalization (DFE).\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Keystone family (MxL9364x, MxL9368x) includes both standalone DSPs and DSPs with monolithically integrated drivers that offer high-swing differential and single-ended output driver options to address both SiPh and EML direct drive applications.  The following channel configurations are available in each case:\r\n\n8x50G to 8x50G\n8x50G to 4x100G\n4x100G to 4x100G\n8x100G to 8x100G",

    "title": "MaxLinear Linearization and Cree GaN on SiC Power Amplifiers Combine to Efficiently Power New Ultra-Wideband 5G",
    "date": "2021-06-23",
    "content": "– June 23, 2021 – \n (NYSE: MXL), a leading provider of radio frequency (RF), analog, digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits, and Cree, Inc. (NASDAQ: CREE), the global leader in Silicon Carbide (SiC) technology through its Wolfspeed business, announced breakthrough performance when combining MaxLinear’s ultra-wideband linearization solution (MaxLin) and Cree’s Wolfspeed® Gallium Nitride (GaN) on SiC mid-band power amplifiers. The new solution increases wireless capacity of a 5G base station, supporting more simultaneous users and increasing the speed of data transmissions.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe use of GaN on SiC with effective linearization accelerates the rollout of 5G by enabling significant power, thermal, and cost savings through more efficient wireless transmission. The power savings from combining Cree’s highly efficient GaN on SiC power amplifiers with a highly effective linearization solution implemented by MaxLinear can be hundreds of watts for the massive MIMO radios that 5G demands.\n\r\n\n\r\n“Our GaN on silicon carbide power amplifiers are designed to achieve high efficiency with extremely wide instantaneous bandwidth in a very small form factor at the newly released 5G spectrum,” said Gerhard Wolf, senior vice president and general manager of RF at Cree | Wolfspeed. “Working with MaxLinear’s solution, this technology demonstrates a significant step forward in achieving outstanding linearity performance and will help wireless providers deliver a superior level of performance and service to mobile customers.”\n\r\n \n\r\nThe new solution tackles a substantial industry challenge: implementing radio units with 5G massive MIMO arrays such as 64x64 or 32x32, while maintaining a reasonable size, weight, and power. The newer 5G spectrum is at a higher carrier frequency and has wider bandwidths, making it more challenging to achieve high power efficiency for radio units.\n\r\n\n\r\n“We are solving a substantial challenge of 5G radios,” said Helen Kim, vice president of MaxLinear’s Wireless Technologies & IP. “Customers need to find a way to deliver mid-band 5G capacity without a commensurate increase in cost and power. Our wideband, power-efficient linearization solution and our low power 400MHz transceivers significantly reduce the heat dissipated by massive MIMO arrays, resulting in a substantially slimmer, lower cost radio solution.”\n\r\n\n\r\nUsing GaN on SiC, MaxLinear’s solution delivers breakthrough linearization performance for a 280 MHz channel to support US 5G spectrum (3.7-3.98GHz) and a 400 MHz channel to support Asian and European 5G mid-band spectrum (3.4-3.8GHz). At 280MHz of instantaneous bandwidth, Cree’s WS1A3940 power amplifier achieves ~50% efficiency for the average output power of 39.5dBm, MaxLinear’s MxL1600 transceiver provides a sampling rate of 983MSPS, and MaxLin improves linearity by >20dB to exceed 3\n Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requirements with margin. Using the Wolfspeed WS1A3640 power amplifier, MaxLin also demonstrates a >20dB linearization improvement at 400MHz of instantaneous bandwidth.\n\r\n\n\r\nCree’s WS1A3940 and WS1A3640 GaN on SiC power amplifier modules, MaxLinear’s MxL15xx and MxL16xx 400MHz transceivers, and MaxLinear’s MaxLin linearization technology are solutions that enable both traditional and Open RAN innovations.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo learn more about Cree | Wolfspeed and its products, please visit \n.

    "title": "MaxLinear Industrial IoT Evaluation Platform Combines G.hn Gigabit Capability with Common Industrial Interfaces",
    "date": "2021-08-25",
    "content": "– Aug 25, 2021 – MaxLinear, Inc. (NYSE: MXL), a leading provider of radio frequency (RF), analog, digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits, announced today the release of its new G.hn evaluation platform, the DMI920. MaxLinear’s G.hn technology reliably transports high-speed data over new or existing AC or DC powerlines, twisted pair, or coaxial cable. The DMI920 combines MaxLinear’s G.hn technology with its USB, Ethernet, and serial communication products enabling OEMs to evaluate this reliable high-speed networking solution with common Industrial interfaces including Ethernet, RS-485/232 and USB.\n\r\n \n\r\nThe need for gigabit bandwidth in industrial IoT (IIoT) applications continues to grow as high-speed IoT devices like imaging sensors and video cameras are increasingly being deployed to enable basic industrial automation, system control, and even advanced AI capabilities. Wireless technologies cannot operate reliably in the extreme conditions presented by the various obstructions ubiquitous to industrial environments such as, concrete walls, brick, or sheet metal that severely impair the quality and reliability of wireless signals. In the harsh industrial environment, communication interferences greatly increase the risk of production down-time or even on-site injuries. As a result, a range of wired links or cabling is preferred over wireless medium to send low-speed serial communications to control and connect industrial applications. G.hn can utilize the existing cables in industrial environments to reliably deliver high-speed, multigigabit data to local area networks which are in turn connected to IIoT endpoint devices through common Industrial interfaces.\n\r\n \n\r\nThe DMI920 utilizes MaxLinear’s G.hn, interface, and power products along with its G.hn Spirit Grid software. The Spirit Grid software development kit (SDK) includes all device drivers and can be easily ported by OEM customers. This solution supports a large-scale, multi-hop network of up to 250 end points with one network controller addressing a wide variety of applications such as smart elevator control systems, fire alarm control panels, smart parking systems, smart fuel dispensers, building entry and access control systems, building security and surveillance, and smart building data backbone networks.\n\r\n \n\r\nKey DMI920 components:\r\n\n88LX5153A+88LX2741: G.hn Wave-2 baseband & analog frontend chipset\nXR77103-G1R2: Pre-programmed, 3-output power management IC \nSP336E: Multi-protocol transceiver\nGPY115: Single-port industrial 1GbE PHY\nXR22800: Hi-Speed USB to 10/100 Ethernet bridge with I\nC Master and GPIOs",

    "date": "2022-02-15",
    "content": "CARLSBAD, CA – February 15, 2022 – \n (NASDAQ: MXL) today announced its collaboration with Intel on a new reference design for next-generation 5G infrastructure Radio Units (RUs) that delivers industry-leading power amplifier (PA) performance and efficiency.\n\r\n\n\r\nCombining Intel's high performance and low power Agilex FPGA family with MaxLinear RF transceivers and MaxLIN\n ultra-wideband digital predistortion (DPD) solution allows developers to deliver new radio units rapidly and cost-effectively with pre-integrated and pre-tested cutting-edge linearization capabilities.\n\r\n\n\r\nRadio Access Network (RAN) product developers are challenged to deliver quickly higher bandwidth, more compact, and lighter radios that support new 5G spectrum while simultaneously increasing energy efficiency. Implementing higher bandwidths at higher 5G RF frequencies also drives engineers to use new PA technologies such as Gallium Nitride (GaN) and Doherty architectures. To harness these exciting technologies in practical deployable radios, high-performance DPD signal processing is necessary to linearize the PA output. In addition, designers want a proven off-the-shelf solution for implementing an O-RAN Alliance compliant fronthaul interface. This joint solution addresses these challenges. Together MaxLinear and Intel are combining Intel\n Agilex™ FPGAs and O-RAN interface IP with MaxLinear RF Transceivers and DPD IP to provide a complete programmable pre-verified software-defined radio (SDR) platform with the highest integration and lowest power consumption for macro, massive MIMO, and small cell applications.\n\r\n\n\r\n“The Open RAN ecosystem will immediately benefit from our cooperation with industry leader Intel.

(Nasdaq: MXL), a leader in wireless infrastructure silicon solutions, today announced it has launched the MXL17xxx family of devices (“Sierra”), a highly integrated SoC optimized for 4G/5G Open Radio Access Network (RAN) radio units (RU). Sierra is an innovative single-chip platform that flexibly supports major RU applications including traditional macro, massive MIMO, picocell, all-in-one small cells, and more.\nSierra integrates the following sub-systems into a single chip, providing a complete software-programmable radio signal processing engine for Open RUs (O-RU):\nRF transceiver supporting up to 8 transmitters, 8 receivers, and 2 feedback receivers\nDigital Front End (DFE) including DPD, crest factor reduction (CFR), and Passive Intermodulation (PIM) cancellation\nLow-PHY baseband processor supporting 5G, 4G, and NB-IoT air interfaces\nO-RAN Alliance Split 7.2x fronthaul interface\n“Infrastructure vendors have been waiting for an open-market silicon solution that can enable them to develop O-RUs without compromise on performance or cost,” said Sean Martin, Senior Director of Wireless Infrastructure. “By integrating our highest performance RF and system technologies in Sierra, MaxLinear is empowering these radio vendors to rapidly and cost effectively develop new O-RUs with reduced size, weight, and power consumption.”\nSierra’s complete system integration yields a feature-rich, high-performance RU building block with low power consumption, board footprint, and implementation cost that reduces the need for multiple FPGAs/ASICs and massively simplifies new O-RU development. Designers can rapidly build new macro and picocell O-RUs using just a single Sierra device by adding an appropriate RF front end. Massive MIMO O-RU are created by tiling an array of Sierra devices and connecting them to a central beamforming solution. This system modularity and flexibility makes Sierra an ideal radio platform building block to maximize design reuse and dramatically speed up the development of new O-RUs.\n“Open RAN momentum continues to build and is set to account for 20 percent to 30 percent of worldwide RAN revenues by 2028,” said Stefan Pongratz, Vice President and Analyst at the Dell’Oro Group. “New optimized off-the-shelf O-RU silicon solutions like Sierra play an essential role to enable improved radio supplier diversity.”\nAt the heart of Sierra is MaxLIN™, MaxLinear’s leading field-proven DPD solution for wideband power amplifier linearization, supporting up to 400MHz of occupied bandwidth. MaxLIN’s linearization performance exceeds the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) unwanted emissions requirements with margin while delivering high PA efficiency, thereby minimizing RU energy consumption, and making radios lighter and more cost-effective. MaxLIN’s advanced algorithms feature enhancements to correct for both long-term and short-term nonlinear dynamics including GaN charge trapping and thermal transients, critical for high-power Macro applications. It optimally supports different power amplifier (PA) architectures, technologies, and power levels for all potential RU applications from macro to picocells. In addition, OEMs also have the option to implement their own DPD using the Sierra on-chip compute resources.\nSierra’s RF transceiver uses a low power wide band Zero-IF (ZIF) architecture and supports 8 transmitters (TX) and 8 receivers (RX) with 2 feedback receivers (FBRX). Each RX supports wide signal bandwidths up to 400MHz and each TX and FBRX supports signal bandwidths up to 900MHz. It can operate in 8T8R single-band or 2 x 4T4R multi-band configurations.\nThe digital front-end (DFE) integrates digital pre-distortion (DPD), crest factor reduction (CFR), passive intermodulation cancellation (PIMC), digital up conversion (DUC), and digital down conversion (DDC) blocks. MaxLinear's advanced DPD/CFR technology, MaxLIN™, linearizes power amplifiers (PA) up to 400MHz of occupied bandwidth and dramatically improves PA energy efficiency while meeting spectral emission masks with margin. The PIMC block cancels passive intermodulation products in the uplink paths to improve receiver sensitivity and relax the specification of expensive RF filters. The DUC/DDC supports up to eight component carriers per transmit and receive path.\nThe Low-PHY baseband processor supports 4G, 5G, and NB-IoT air interfaces, including uplink PRACH processing. It can process up to eight component carriers (CC) per transmit and receive path with subcarrier spacing (SCS) of 15kHz, 30kHz, and 60kHz and it is software configurable for different modes and parameters including dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS), bandwidth parts, mixed numerology, and windowing.\nSierra supports an O-RAN fronthaul Split Option 7.2x Category A interface with up to four 10 or 25 Gbit/s Ethernet interfaces.\nSierra integrates an embedded CPU for system control. The CPU is an integrated quad-core Arm® A53 processor with Neon™ extensions. Each Arm® core has 1MB of internal SRAM and has access to an additional 8GB of external DRAM through a DDR controller.\nSierra is available in a 31mm x 31mm Flip-Chip Ball Grid Array (FCBGA) package. Sierra is sampling to first customers in March 2024. Sierra samples are supported by an evaluation platform, software, and tools to facilitate early system development.\nMaxLinear will be conducting briefings on MaxLinear’s radio solutions at Mobile World Congress – Hall 2, meeting rooms 2A54MR and 2A63MR – from February 26 through February 29, 2024.",

    "title": "Quality of Service (QoS) Mechanisms in Wi-Fi",
    "date": "2024-05-24",
    "content": "(QoS) is a set of protocols and techniques to prioritize specific data services within a network to improve KPIs such as \n, thereby improving user experience. Each of these data services has a specific set of QoS requirements. In the early days of Wi-Fi, the technology functioned on a \"best-effort\" basis, ensuring fairness in accessing the wireless medium without differentiating traffic based on e.g., priorities. However, this model proved inadequate as applications requiring real-time data transmission with time bounded latency, such as voice and video streaming, became increasingly common. To overcome these challenges, various QoS mechanisms have been introduced into the Wi-Fi standard. They enhance network performance by employing strategies like traffic prioritization, bandwidth allocation, and congestion management, offering a more satisfactory user experience.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n is another critical parameter for evaluating network efficiency, which quantifies the amount of data transferred over the network over time. Various factors, including wireless signal strength, interference levels and competing network traffic, can affect throughput and other KPIs. While throughput measures the data transmission capacity of the network, QoS works to fine-tune high-priority services and applications. Throughput and QoS are both essential for network performance.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn Overlapping Basic Service Sets\nscenarios, several BSSs (i.e., “networks”) use the same primary channel. In this case, bandwidth becomes a shared resource and diminishes the resources available to each BSS individually. This setup poses distinct challenges in upholding the required QoS levels in each BSS, without degrading the other BSSs. While current mechanisms may be adequate at regulating QoS within its own BSS, it may overlook the traffic conditions in the OBSS. As a result, if each BSS maximizes its traffic without accounting for the OBSS sharing the wireless resources, can lead to system-wide complications.\n\r\n\n\r\nOver the years, successive generations of Wi-Fi standards have typically raised the bar on throughput, but they have also added crucial features intended to facilitate QoS. In this paper, we’ll provide an overview of these QoS-related Wi-Fi features and offer insights into potential areas for future improvements.\n\r\nThe initial Wi-Fi standards were published in 1997 and 1999. One of the fundamental decisions was how to regulate access of multiple devices to a shared medium. To this end, Wi-Fi adopted CSMA/CA (“Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance”) as the basic mechanism.\n\r\n\n\r\nWi-Fi's early days started with two fundamental functions for channel access: the Distributed Coordination Function \n and the Point Coordination Function \n.\nDCF (Distributed Coordination Function) implements the CSMA/CA access method. It checks the radio link for any activity before sending (\"Carrier Sensing”). When the link is found to be idle, devices will wait for a random delay (“backoff”) before transmitting. During this delay, the medium continues to be monitored and transmission is suspended if any activity is detected before the end of the backoff. This random delay reduces the probability of collisions (\"Collision Avoidance”). \nPCF (Point Coordination Function) provides a contention-free access method controlled by a central controller block (Point Coordinator or PC), typically an access point. The PC has higher priority to the medium and can reserve the medium to essentially create contention free periods. Within those periods it can direct (“poll”) specific devices to transmit. After the contention-free access time window finishes, medium access reverts to DCF. This procedure is repeated cyclically. \nDCF ensured fairness for contention; however, it lacked the specialized features necessary for QoS management. This meant it couldn't differentiate between various types of data traffic, such as real-time video or latency-sensitive voice applications, which led to limitations in delivering a consistent and reliable user experience. \nAnother important problem related to DCF is that its throughput performance drops under high congestion scenarios, which also affects the rest of the KPIs. Figure 1 illustrates the behavior of network throughput as a function of the network load (essentially, the number of contending devices). It shows two different curves under two congestion regions. The left side means no congestion; the network's aggregated throughput increases with the number of devices until it reaches the capacity limit of the network, and we are under congestion conditions. Depending on the approach, the behavior on the right side of the figure will be different. In addition to the throughput decrease, the latency KPI increases, making it difficult to meet QoS requirements.\n\r\n\n\r\nPCF provided a PC-directed way of selectively allowing certain devices to the medium, providing the basis of QoS. However, PCF is rarely used and has been deprecated in later versions of the Wi-Fi standard.\n\r\nRecognizing these limitations, appropriate additions to the Wi-Fi standard became necessary. Later amendments to the standard aimed to address the deficiencies of DCF and PCF, introducing new protocols and mechanisms to prioritize and manage different types of traffic more efficiently. This transformation ultimately resulted in a significantly enhanced Wi-Fi experience, especially for applications demanding QoS guarantees.\nUnderstanding the need for native QoS support within Wi-Fi, the 802.11 standards group commenced work on a new amendment 802.11e (\"Medium Access Control (MAC) Quality of Service Enhancements”). This amendment was finalized and published in 2005. Note that some of these featured were adopted by the Wi-Fi Alliance (WFA) through its Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM) program (see later).\n\r\nThe best features of DCF and PCF were combined to create the Hybrid Coordination Function \n. HCF introduced new \n features like Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) and HCF Controlled Channel Access \n, also adding support to Traffic Specification \n for the management of QoS traffic requirements.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n (Enhanced Distributed Channel Access) categorizes traffic into Access Categories (ACs) to obtain different priority classifications. Each AC has its own message queue and specific contention parameters (AIFS & CW) for accessing the wireless medium. For instance, voice might be given the highest priority, while background data traffic might be given the lowest. EDCA ensures critical data, like voice and video, can get prioritized access in Wi-Fi networks over other types of traffic (Best effort and Background).\n\r\n\n\r\n802.11e also allows the device that gains access to the medium to maintain control for more than a single transmission in a so-called Transmit Opportunity (TXOP). With TXOP, a station can send multiple frames without being interrupted by other stations trying to use the channel. \n\r\n\n\r\n\n(HCF Controlled Channel Access) is a polled access mechanism where a Hybrid Coordinator (HC) schedules contention free period TXOPs for the STAs, within a Controlled Access Phase (CAP), which can be repeated along the Beacon periods. HCCA is different because it uses a central scheduler to decide when stations can use the channel, allowing to guarantee QoS for high priority services (Voice and Video ACs). The AP ensures the access to the wireless medium by contending for the channel with more aggressive contention parameters. Contention Access Periods (CAPs) are allocated as necessary, with the remaining time utilized by Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA).\n\r\n\n\r\n\n (Traffic Specification) defines the QoS requirements of a data flow or Traffic Stream (TS), detailing attributes such as data rate, delay limits, and traffic nature. The stations (STAs) may request the Access Point (AP) for the admission of such TS for some specific QoS requirements, assigned to a Traffic Stream Identifier (TSID). The AP may deny by means of admission control, which guards against network overload, preserving the set QoS standards crucial for VoIP and video streaming applications. Ethernet frames can carry an optional higher layer 802.1Q tag called DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point) for traffic priority. By means of the TCLAS (Traffic Classification) parameter set, it is possible to identify such frames belonging to a particular TS, and hence to the corresponding AC. However, there is no direct map between DSCP and the ACs.\n\r\n\n\r\nFigure 2 depicts how EDCA and HCCA interact, showing the queues architecture for each of the ACs. By means of TSPEC requests, the STAs may reserve resources for their traffic streams. Each of these streams are classified and enqueued, depending on the access method used. EDCA has four queues, while HCCA may use one queue for managing its own TSPEC configurations.\n\r\n\n802.11e remained the corner stone for QoS in Wi-Fi. Later amendments like 802.11n and 802.11ac focused on enhancing throughput over QoS features. The spectacular throughput enhancements of 802.11n (from 54 Mbps to 450 Mbps maximum PHY rate) were provided by some innovative PHY and MAC features. For instance:\nuses multiple antennas to achieve higher data rates. \n enabled sending multiple MAC frames in a single transmission, minimizing MAC overhead. \nAdditionally, 802.11ac extends the channel bandwidth to as much as 160 MHz. 802.11ac also introduced Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO), which facilitates concurrent communication with several devices. \nAlthough not primarily engineered for QoS, providing increased throughput increases resources for the network and thereby indirectly reduces network latency and congestion. \nThis amendment (officially named “MAC Enhancements for Robust Audio Video Streaming”) was based on the work done in 802.11e and focused on enhancing audio and video transport over \n\r\nwireless networks to better support video streaming applications. \n802.11aa introduced several mechanisms related to improvement of the QoS, such as:\n \n(Stream Classification Service) allows a STA to explicitly request downlink resources to the AP for meeting QoS requirements for applying to specific traffic flows. One of the main differences with the TSPEC feature is that SCS applies QoS rules to a Traffic Identifier (TID) or 802.1Q User Priority (UP), making it more generic that TSPEC. After classification, these data frames are allocated to an access category and tagged for drop eligibility. Drop eligibility indicates whether a traffic flow can be discarded if it runs out of buffer space or bandwidth.\n Management mechanisms were introduced, divided into different features. \r\n\t\nAdditional Qload metrics were defined, which try to quantify each BSS load, classified in different types of network traffic. These metrics are exchanged between the OBSS APs, to ensure that the requested new traffic will not interfere with current admitted traffic. \nHCCA enhancements for coordinating two or more AP HCs by means of exchanging between the APs their time scheduled CAP information. This time coordination allows to avoid collisions between the CAPs of each BSS, solving one of the major HCCA problems.\n\r\n\t\nLike 802.11e, 802.11aa tried to enhance the QoS related features and overcome some of the drawbacks found in the previous QoS standard, including HCCA. Still, HCCA has not found widespread application even with these enhancements\nThe 2016 release of the 802.11 standard extended to SCS concept introduced in 802.11aa.\n (Mirrored stream classification service) enables a client device to request the AP to apply specific QoS requirements of downlink data flows using QoS mirroring. It means that instead of requesting explicitly as in the case of SCS feature, MSCS monitors the corresponding uplink flows sent by the STA, and the AP derives QoS rules for downlink flows. MCSC does not replace SCS, both are complementary and designed to be used independently or together.\n802.11ax and 802.11be provided the next generation of Wi-Fi after 802.11ac by adding new features such as OFDMA, Multi-Link Operation (MLO), 1024-QAM, 4096 QAM, and BSS Coloring. With these amendments, the focus on QoS was less immediate, but the enhanced throughput and resource flexibility provided by 802.11ax and 802.11be indirectly provide new mechanisms \n\r\nto enhance QoS.\n allows multiple users to share a single channel by dividing it into smaller sub-channels. This boosts efficiency, reduces latency, and improves throughput. \n is a modulation scheme that encodes 10 bits per symbol, allowing for higher data rates. It’s used in Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 7 for greater throughput but requires a higher signal-to-noise ratio.\n is a modulation scheme that encodes 12 bits of data per symbol, allowing for high data throughput. However, it’s more sensitive to noise and requires favorable channel conditions.\n (Multi-Link Operation) allows a station to establish multiple links in multiple bands with one or more access points for improved reliability, throughput, and latency.\n labels frame headers from an access point with numerical “colors” for easy network identification by client devices. This minimizes co-channel interference and enhances network performance.\n: 802.11be introduced the QoS characteristics element to SCS and restricted TWT procedures, enabling the possibility of requesting QoS resources for traffic flows in downlink, uplink, and peer-to-peer directions. \nOne important innovation in 802.11ax was the introduction of Triggered Uplink Access \n as a channel access mechanism. \n is somewhat reminiscent of the PCF mechanism. \n enhances uplink performance by enabling client devices to send data upon receiving a \"trigger\" frame from the access point. This synchronized approach cuts down on waiting periods and contention, thus lowering latency. It also fine-tunes the use of the uplink channel among multiple devices, boosting overall network efficiency since fewer devices need to contend for the medium. This effectively shifts network access toward a more scheduled approach controlled by the access point. Setting MU EDCA parameters allow the AP to control the extent to which client devices will use contention as opposed to \n.\nA table of Throughput and QoS enhancements features in the standards is shown below in Table 1.\n\r\n\nThe 802.11 standards body defines technical specifications for the successive Wi-Fi generations. The Wi-Fi Alliance (WFA) builds upon these standards to define industry programs that bundle some of the more salient features into comprehensive test and certification programs, occasionally even adding features in addition to what is defined in 802.11. Several WFA programs are specifically focused on QoS.\nFor instance, WFA’s Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM) program, is based on a subset of the IEEE 802.11e standard, adopting EDCA, TXOP and TSPEC features. As in the IEEE standard, WMM classifies traffic into the same four access categories, defining how to map directly into the predefined 802.1Q user priorities.\nBuilding on WMM, the WFA's Wi-Fi CERTIFIED QoS Management™ specification harmonizes QoS treatments between wired and Wi-Fi networks, allowing devices to assign specific application IP flows to WMM-defined categories. This can be done by means of the direct mapping between the DSCP tags and user priorities (DSCP-to-AC mechanism), and therefore with the Wi-Fi access categories. Additionally, it adopted SCS and MSCS mechanisms for QoS management, which helped to address some of the evolving user needs for consistent QoS in Wi-Fi environments.\nWi-Fi standards have evolved to meet the growing demands of modern applications. One of the crucial threads of this progression is the need for improved Quality of Service (QoS). Over the years, Wi-Fi has provided native features to enhance QoS in various ways.\nThe diversity of applications like IoT devices, augmented reality, telemedicine, real-time gaming, and ultra-high-definition \n has evolved. The complexity of scenarios often includes congested networks with repeaters. These applications have varying traffic requirements; some need \n and others require \nCurrent QoS mechanisms all work in combination with a contention-based protocol (DCF). While contention-based mechanisms can address many needs, they may fail to ensure timely data delivery for critical applications in increasingly congested environments. As the number of Wi-Fi devices continues to grow and congestion becomes more likely, it may be necessary to consider other forms of network access that rely more on central scheduling, as HCCA has attempted to do in the past.\nWhile HCCA did not take off in the market, some form of Hybrid Coordinator \n collocated within the Access Point, could be revamped to incorporate the need for time-sensitive wireless tools. The network can prioritize resources by introducing \n alongside \nmechanisms. This scheduled access can reserve transmission opportunities (TXOPs) for high-priority tasks, ensuring that \n data is not at the mercy of network congestion. Such a new network access mechanism would also have to be robust in the presence of OBSS and be defined in a way that allows coexistence with legacy devices.\nEfficient use of the wireless spectrum is not just about maximizing throughput but also about ensuring the timely and reliable delivery of packets. Applications demanding high QoS, like VoIP calls, video streaming, or online gaming can improve, even in a congested environment. It could guarantee end-users a superior and consistent experience. As emerging technologies push the boundaries of what's possible in wireless networks, a robust QoS mechanism ensures that the next Wi-Fi standard can handle future innovations.",
